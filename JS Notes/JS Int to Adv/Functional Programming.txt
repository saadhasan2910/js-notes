Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions, which do not have side effects and always return the same output for a given input. In functional programming, data is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once it has been created. This programming paradigm is becoming increasingly popular due to its benefits such as maintainability, predictability, and testability.

JavaScript provides many features for functional programming, such as higher-order functions, closures, and anonymous functions. Here are some key concepts in functional programming:

Pure functions: Pure functions are functions that do not have side effects and always return the same output for a given input. Pure functions do not modify any external state and do not rely on external state. Pure functions are easy to test and can be composed together to create more complex functions.

// Example of a pure function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}


Higher-order functions: Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result. Higher-order functions are often used for composition and abstraction.

// Example of a higher-order function
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor;
  }
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10

// Example of a higher-order function
function multiplyBy(factor) {
  return function (number) {
    return number * factor;
  }
}

const double = multiplyBy(2);
console.log(double(5)); // 10

Closures: Closures are functions that have access to variables in their outer scope, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are often used to create private variables and to encapsulate state.

// Example of a closure
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2

Immutable data: In functional programming, data is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed once it has been created. This ensures that the data is not accidentally modified and makes it easier to reason about the code.

// Example of immutable data
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubledNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * 2);
console.log(doubledNumbers); // [2, 4, 6]
console.log(numbers); // [1, 2, 3]

Anonymous functions: Anonymous functions are functions that do not have a name and are often used as arguments to higher-order functions.

// Example of an anonymous function
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function (number) {
  return number % 2 === 0;
});
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2]

Functional programming can be used alongside other programming paradigms in JavaScript to create maintainable and predictable code.
